\chapter{Accurate Newton's Method for B\'{e}zier Curve Intersection}
\label{chap:compensated-newton}

\section{Introduction}

By just using a more precise evaluation of the residual function,
\cite{Tisseur2001} showed that the accuracy of Newton's method can
be improved. This explores the improvement in Newton's method applied both to
root-finding and B\'{e}zier curve intersection.

%% In Section 4 we will need an extension of the concept of simple roots to
%% the intersection of two Bezier curves. An
%% intersection f(sigma) = g(tau) is called a transversal intersection if
%%     det[ f'(sigma) g'(tau) ] != 0,
%% which is equivalent to the derivatives not being zero or parallel at
%% the intersection.
