The problem of data transfer between meshes arises frequently in
computational physics, e.g. in Lagrangian methods where remeshing
occurs. The interpolation process must be conservative, i.e. it
must conserve physical properties, such as mass. We extend previous
works --- which described the data transfer process for straight sided
unstructured meshes --- by considering high-order isoparametric meshes
with curved elements. The implementation is highly reliant on accurate
computational geometry routines for evaluating points on and
intersecting B\'{e}zier curves and triangles.

Two ill-conditioned problems that occur evaluating points on and
intersecting B\'{e}zier curves are then explored. This work presents a
family of compensated algorithms to accurately evaluate a polynomial in
Bernstein form with floating point coefficients. The principle is to apply
error-free transformations to improve the traditional de Casteljau
algorithm. The resulting output is as accurate as the de Casteljau
algorithm performed in \(K\) times the working precision. After
compensated evaluation is considered, a compensated Newton's method is
described, both for root-finding for polynomials in the Bernstein basis
and for B\'{e}zier curve intersection.
