In computer aided geometric design a polynomial is usually represented in
Bernstein form. This paper presents a family of compensated algorithms to
accurately evaluate a polynomial in Bernstein form with floating point
coefficients. The principle is to apply error-free transformations to
improve the traditional de Casteljau algorithm. At each stage of computation,
round-off error is passed on to first order errors, then to second order
errors, and so on. After the computation has been ``filtered'' \((K - 1)\)
times via this process, the resulting output is as accurate as the de Casteljau
algorithm performed in \(K\) times the working precision. Forward error
analysis and numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy of this family
of algorithms.
